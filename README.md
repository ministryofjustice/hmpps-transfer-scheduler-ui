A frontend application for HMPPS prison staff to schedule transfers for prisoners.


## Overview

This service allows prison staff to:
- Plan, schedule and manage prisoner transfers
- View transfer history and audit logs

## Getting Started

### Installation

```bash
npm ci
```
### Configuration
Create a copy of the `.env.example` file:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Update the environment variables in `.env` to match your environment.
Dev environment secrets can be retrieved with the following commands:
```bash
kubectl -n hmpps-transfer-scheduler-dev get secret hmpps-transfer-scheduler-ui-client-creds -o json | jq -r ".data | map_values(@base64d)"
kubectl -n hmpps-transfer-scheduler-dev get secret hmpps-transfer-scheduler-ui-auth-code -o json | jq -r ".data | map_values(@base64d)"
```

### Running Locally
After setting up `.env` with the necessary credentials from dev environment, run the application directly:

```bash
npm run start:dev
```

The application will be available at http://localhost:3000

As copied from `.env.example`, the API endpoint would be point at the dev environment. Edit `.env` accordingly if pointing to a local instance of API service is preferred.

## Development

### Build

```bash
npm run build
```

### Run Tests

#### Unit Tests
`npm run test`

#### Integration Tests
For local running, start a wiremock instance by:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose-test.yml up
```

Install Playwright if it has not been installed previously:
```bash
npx playwright install
```

Then run the server in test mode by:
```bash
npm run start-feature:dev
npm run int-test
```

Or run tests with the Playwright UI:
`npm run int-test-ui`

By default, playwright will run in 8 parallel workers. This can be changed by setting the `PARALLEL_WORKERS` environment variable in your shell (ie, `~/.zshrc` or `~/.zprofile`).

### Code Quality
```bash
npm run lint

npm run lint-fix
```

### Syncing API Types With Swagger

Run `npm run swagger` to pull the latest typedefs from the api backend.
